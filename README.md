# Dragon Scourge Revival by Fhiz
- *Fhiz* started to work on a total refactor of the old codebase in 2020
- The plan is to update the code in order to be functional on PHP7, then refactor the codebase, make it fully responsive & mobile capable and finally polish it.

# Jamin's Original comment

Many years ago, when I was young and dumb, I wrote a [simple little game](https://github.com/renderse7en/dragon-knight) based on the game *Dragon Warrior* for the NES. It was fun, it helped me learn how to code, and a lot of people liked it.

After that, I begin writing a sequel, of sorts, called Dragon Scourge. I never really finished that game. Life got in the way. Got married. Got a job. Had kids. All that.

I'm now turning it over to the open source community. 

As with Dragon Knight before it, please keep some things in mind:
- It's super old. It may not even work on modern versions of PHP. It may have security issues. I have no idea.
- I have moved on with my life, and am no longer changing or doing anything with this game.
- I am not providing help or support. You're on your own.
- I am not accepting pull requests. If you fork this, you are welcome to do whatever you want, but no changes will be merged back into this.
- Quite frankly, I don't really suggest that you use this as is. It's probably better as an inspiration for your own project. 
- Have fun with this. I gave it a lot of love a long time ago. I hope it inspires you to give something a lot of love as well.
- This Git repo represents the final released version, Beta 5 Build 20, originally released 9/2/2007.
